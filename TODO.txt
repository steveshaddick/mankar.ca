Manuals upload

I wonder if the first fail was because of a space in the name, but once I had one fail it keeps them all in the queue, even for a different product.

I started with the MAFEX ULV Potato machine, then switched to a BEMA 500, and the error now shows as:

--------------------------------ERROR UPDATING------------------------------------------
There was an error uploading MAFEX install tips_merged.pdf
There was an error uploading MAFEX_potato_manual.pdf
There was an error uploading MAFEX_potato_manual.pdf
There was an error uploading BEMA-500-manual.pdf

So there is something wonky there.  It is not forgetting older failed uploads, and also not uploading!

I inserted some youtubes into a page, but they don't show up.

See:
http://dev.mankarulv.com/simple-cms/products/edit/6?error=
and:
http://dev.mankarulv.com/mini-mantra-plus-ulv-sprayer

perhaps my link format is wrong?  If so (or either way) on the cms page could you put the example for the format you want?

I inserted a new dealer with no website, but the form seems to autofill an http:

The parts page output:
http://dev.mankarulv.com/parts?pid=10
Could we have it so it orders by part number, and also shows the part number?  Kind of like a table?

---------------------------------------------------------
the mini logos in the left column don't look very crisp - are we trying to fit too much detail in there?
I don't have that font and can't find it with identifont either.  
Maybe the logos got to go?  Your thoughts?
these guys have something very similar called Reaction Bold : http://www.fontsforflash.com/

---------------------------------------------------------

on the dealer pages, the maps are pushed at narrow window settings by unbroken web addresses or email addresses.

in that case should we trim the map to size?  I mean hide the part of the map that goes further than the 10 pixels from the edge or whatever they normally do.

---------------------------------------------------------

noticed a weird thing when uploading a dealer logo:
I uploaded a PNG, it converted it to JPG and filled in the clear with black.
no need to fix, easy to work around, but i found it funny.
---------------------------------------------------------
Dealers page 
ex: http://dev.mantisulv.com/dealers

should check if there are US AND Canadian dealers before putting that up.  If only one county, hide the US/Canada thingie

Secondly, if they have US IP should we put US first?

we had talked before about the following for measurements:
if cookie set from previous visit, use that setting
if not, if they have a US IP set to US, otherwise metric
