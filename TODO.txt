Organized highest to lowest priority (from Nick's point of view)

Look at this page:

http://dev.mankarulv.com/information

as you get narrower than around 1200px or so, the horizontal submenu wraps in a funny way.  it goes under the dividing line and pushes the title of the page aside.
I would suggest the submenu stays above the line, and that if possible they wrap evenly (so if there are 4 menu items, it goes to 2 and 2) if that is not too much work.

[steve]Can we rename the titles so that they don't take up so much space?

on content/parts-main, I do not know how to edit the code so it lists only MAFEX in the dropdown, for example.

If a Product Type has only one product, we skip directly to the product.

or, you could add it to the CMS in the product type section, where we can do a checkbox to "skip to product file" and then a dropdown to choose which product.
--------------------------------------------------------
 if a certain language doesn't have metadata, it seems to default to some kind of site default metadata.  Would it be better to have it default to the page-specific English metadata first, if there is some?

 look at the bottom of this page:

 when adding new products, it doesn't seem to be making the image that should go in those boxes

 I could not edit 1, 6,7, or 9.  "ERROR UPDATING"

 Also, in the datepicker if you change the date it leaves the year in there, which then does not save anything in the date field
