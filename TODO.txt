Organized highest to lowest priority (from Nick's point of view)

On both IE9 and FF15, it is not holding the Language between supertypes.  Nor the unit of measurement.  Is it because separate domains can't share cookies?  Can we embed that info in the link?  I bet you can wizard!

---------------------------------------------------------
In Firefox 17, http://dev.mankarulv.com/comparison breaks the page.
At narrow widths the right side wants to overlap it.
Even at wide widths, the left part of the tool is being cut off.

---------------------------------------------------------

the mini logos in the left column don't look very crisp - are we trying to fit too much detail in there?
I don't have that font and can't find it with identifont either.  
Maybe the logos got to go?  Your thoughts?
these guys have something very similar called Reaction Bold : http://www.fontsforflash.com/

on the dealer pages, the maps are pushed at narrow window settings by unbroken web addresses or email addresses.

in that case should we trim the map to size?  I mean hide the part of the map that goes further than the 10 pixels from the edge or whatever they normally do.

Dealers page 
ex: http://dev.mantisulv.com/dealers

should check if there are US AND Canadian dealers before putting that up.  If only one county, hide the US/Canada thingie

Secondly, if they have US IP should we put US first?

we had talked before about the following for measurements:
if cookie set from previous visit, use that setting
if not, if they have a US IP set to US, otherwise metric
