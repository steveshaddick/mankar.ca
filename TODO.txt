Other Products in left column
-add Mankar Logo
-make them two-line entries:

Mankar ULV Applicators for herbicide
Mafex ULV Fine spray units for Potatoes and Fruit
ROFA ULV Sprayer for insecticides
Mantis ULV Applicator for form release

I hope it doesn't look too strange.  People may not be familiar with the brands, so we need something to explain.

Look at this page:

http://dev.mankarulv.com/information

as you get narrower than around 1200px or so, the horizontal submenu wraps in a funny way.  it goes under the dividing line and pushes the title of the page aside.

I would suggest the submenu stays above the line, and that if possible they wrap evenly (so if there are 4 menu items, it goes to 2 and 2) if that is not too much work.

Logos need to switch when we change websites!

on content/parts-main, I do not know how to edit the code so it lists only MAFEX in the dropdown, for example.
