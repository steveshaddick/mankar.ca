On both IE9 and FF15, it is not holding the Language between supertypes.  Nor the unit of measurement.  Is it because separate domains can't share cookies?  Can we embed that info in the link?  I bet you can wizard!

---------------------------------------------------------

The parts page output:
http://dev.mankarulv.com/parts?pid=10
Could we have it so it orders by part number, and also shows the part number?  Kind of like a table?  Also if they have the picture we could show a small picture.

---------------------------------------------------------
the mini logos in the left column don't look very crisp - are we trying to fit too much detail in there?
I don't have that font and can't find it with identifont either.  
Maybe the logos got to go?  Your thoughts?
these guys have something very similar called Reaction Bold : http://www.fontsforflash.com/

on the dealer pages, the maps are pushed at narrow window settings by unbroken web addresses or email addresses.

in that case should we trim the map to size?  I mean hide the part of the map that goes further than the 10 pixels from the edge or whatever they normally do.

---------------------------------------------------------
Dealers page 
ex: http://dev.mantisulv.com/dealers

should check if there are US AND Canadian dealers before putting that up.  If only one county, hide the US/Canada thingie

Secondly, if they have US IP should we put US first?

we had talked before about the following for measurements:
if cookie set from previous visit, use that setting
if not, if they have a US IP set to US, otherwise metric

I put this at the bottom as it may be outside the scope of this update.
However, I am getting a growning collection of French (and even Spanish) manuals

It would be good to have these show up in the different language sections.  This may be a big deal coding wise, or maybe not.  Let me know.
