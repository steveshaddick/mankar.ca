Look at this page:

http://dev.mankarulv.com/information

as you get narrower than around 1200px or so, the horizontal submenu wraps in a funny way.  it goes under the dividing line and pushes the title of the page aside.

I would suggest the submenu stays above the line, and that if possible they wrap evenly (so if there are 4 menu items, it goes to 2 and 2) if that is not too much work.
