Creating new products or editing them.
-picture not saving
-metadata not saving
-photos going into strip not saving
-I try to save the photostrip (even though it is not saving photos) and I get:
Fatal error: Call to undefined function removeQuotes() in /usr/local/pem/vhosts/146281/webspace/httpdocs/dev/models/SimpleCMS.php on line 575

http://dev.mankarulv.com/simple-cms/products/edit

on a positive note, it still works when I name the product and product type the same and it just sneaks over to the product!

throwing an error:

Other Products in left column
-add Mankar Logo
-make them two-line entries:

Mankar ULV Applicators for herbicide
Mafex ULV Fine spray units for Potatoes and Fruit
ROFA ULV Sprayer for insecticides
Mantis ULV Applicator for form release

I hope it doesn't look too strange.  People may not be familiar with the brands, so we need something to explain.

Look at this page:

http://dev.mankarulv.com/information

as you get narrower than around 1200px or so, the horizontal submenu wraps in a funny way.  it goes under the dividing line and pushes the title of the page aside.

I would suggest the submenu stays above the line, and that if possible they wrap evenly (so if there are 4 menu items, it goes to 2 and 2) if that is not too much work.

Logos need to switch when we change websites!
