				<h2>Saves Time</h2>
				<p>Generally speaking you can apply your concentrated product, so there is no mizing or measuring needed.  Also, no pumping as it is a pressureless delivery system.</p>
				<h2>Lightweight</h2>
				<p>The ROFA weighs only 2.4 kgs (5.3 lbs.)!</p>
				<a href="<?php echo PICTURES_LOCATION; ?>rofa-demo.jpg" rel="lightbox[rofabenefits]" title="You get great coverage with the ROFA's even spray pattern."><img class="pleft" src="<?php echo THUMBS_LOCATION; ?>rofa-demo.jpg" alt=""></a>
				<h2>Low Noise</h2>
				<p>Don't disturb your livestock with a high-pressure, high noise sprayer when you can keep them calm and work around them with the ROFA.</p>
				<h2>Even Coverage</h2>
				<p> With a no-pressure delivery to an industrial rotary atomizer, the ROFA achieves ideal coverage from the lowest possible liquid input.</p>
