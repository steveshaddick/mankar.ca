<p>Recently Mankar Products have been approved for a government cost-share  program as part of the Environmental Farm Plan. &nbsp;The  government pays for 30% of the parts of the sprayers that benefit the  environment by reducing dosage and eliminating drift. &nbsp;This  works out to approximately 12-20% of the sprayer depending on the model!</p>
<p> If you have completed an Environmental Farm Plan you are eligible - if  you have yet to complete one you should contact your local program  representative and get the ball rolling. </p>
