<p><strong>Patented technology</strong><br>
MANKAR&reg; spares resources. Good for the environment, good for your  finances. Only 2-3 litres of herbicide needed per hectare, thanks to  the special ULV (Ultra-Low Volume) technology and patented segment  rotation nozzles. Conventional systems, for example backpack sprayers,  use many times more herbicide for the same area.</p>
<p><strong>Undiluted herbicide application</strong><br>
MANKAR&reg; saves time. No unnecessary work. You can start work right away,  without needing to measure herbicide, add water, or mix. In most cases  herbicides can be used undiluted. MANKAR&reg; eliminates or reduces  time-consuming interruptions for re-filling - no more returning to the  water source every time you need to fill the tank!</p>

<p><strong>Pressureless application.</strong><br>
MANKAR&reg; sprays precisely where you want it to, nowhere else. Thanks to  pressureless application at 90&deg; to the ground and the completely closed  spray cap, drift or mist formation of herbicide is reduced to a  minimum. </p>
<p><strong>High user-comfort</strong><br>
MANKAR&reg; is easy to use. Available as light-weight portable models  weighing as little as 2.9 kg, the MANKAR&reg; range makes light work of  herbicide application. The ergonomic design reduces stress to the  user&rsquo;s back and body. In comparison, a backpack sprayer can weigh 20 kg!</p>
<p><strong>Low-noise operation</strong><br>
MANKAR&reg;, the quiet alternative. Kind to the environment, and people&rsquo;s nerves, thanks to low-noise operation. </p>
<p><strong>Wide range of models and spray widths</strong><br>
Our huge choice of models and spray widths ensures you&rsquo;ll find the ideal solution for your needs.</p>
<p><strong>Battery-powered</strong><br>
MANKAR&reg; comes with rechargeable batteries. No more tangled cables.  Depending on the model, charged batteries provide 8 or 16 hours of  working time.</p>
